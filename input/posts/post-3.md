Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.

No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Uncle Jailbird Joey? I guarantee it. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music.

Who is that guy. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. What was it, George, bird watching?

Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? Yeah, he's right here. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Well uh, good, fine.

Just finishing up the second coat now. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you?

Now Biff, don't con me. No, bastards. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Why am I always the last one to know about these things.
